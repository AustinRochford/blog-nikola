    <p class="card-text">In the last ten years, there have been a number of advancements in the study of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms that have enabled effective Bayesian statistical computation for much more complicated models than were previously feasible. These algorithmic advancements have been accompanied by a number of open source probabilistic programming packages that make them accessible to the general engineering, statistics, and data science communities. PyMC is one such package written in Python and supported by NumFOCUS. This talk will give an introduction to probabilistic programming with PyMC, with a particular emphasis on the how open source probabilistic programming makes Bayesian inference algorithms near the frontier of academic research accessible to a wide audience.</p>

    <p class="card-text">At Monetate, we've deployed Bayesian bandits (both noncontextual and contextual) to help our clients optimize their e-commerce sites since early 2016. This talk is an overview of the lessons we've learned from both the processes of deploying real-time Bayesian machine learning systems at scale and building a data product on top of these systems that is accessible to non-technical users (marketers). This talk will cover:
    <ul>
        <li>The place of multi-armed bandits in the A/B testing industry,</li>
        <li>Thompson sampling and the basic theory of Bayesian bandits,</li>
        <li>Bayesian approaches for accommodating nonstationarity in bandit feedback,</li>
        <li>User experience challenges in driving adoption of these technologies by nontechnical marketers.</li>
    </ul>

    We will focus primarily on noncontextual bandits and give a brief overview of these problems in the contextual setting as time permits.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Since 2015, the NBA has released a detailed report of foul calls and non-calls that occur in the final two minutes of close games. This talk is a case study in using open source Python packages to analyze these reports in order to understand the relationship between game dynamics, player abilities, and foul calls. Our main goal is to quantify the relationship between player ability and foul calls. Since intentional fouls are a ubiquitous part of the NBA endgame, this data set also contains rich information about the relationship between game dynamics and intentional fouls for us to model.</p>
